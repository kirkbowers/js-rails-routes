js-rails-routes [flags]

    Run this command from the base directory of a Ruby on Rails project.
    It will inspect the routes for the Rails project and generate a javascript file
    that will add all the [route_name]_path functions to the global namespace.
    By default, the generated javascript is output to stdout.
    
    Flags:
      --help
        Displays this message
      --output
        Writes the generated javascript to the file:
        app/assets/javascripts/routes.js
        This operation will fail if you are not in the base directory of a Rails project.
        In other words, it does not try to create the subdirectories 
        app/assets/javascripts, so will fail if it can not find them.
        The idea behind requiring you to explicitly type "--output" is to protect 
        against accidentally blowing away an old routes.js file, as this _will_ 
        overwrite it if one exists.
